# RCM
code for the esp32 in the Robot Control Modules

## branch: master

The master branch has all helper functions, but is a blank foundation and won't control anything. Branch off of this when you design a new robot.

## branch: [Robot-A](https://github.com/RCMgames/RCM/discussions/21)

This code controls two drive motors and a servo

## branch: [Robot-B](https://github.com/RCMgames/RCM/discussions/23)

This controls a four wheel omni/mechanum drive and two servos

## branch: Robot-C

This controls a 3 wheel kiwi drive

## branch: [Robot-D](https://github.com/RCMgames/RCM/discussions/22)

This controls a robot with two drive motor channels, a flywheel, a servo intake, an adjustible hood, and a laser
